## Welcome

This documentation provides guidance for integrating your application with the Zuwinda API. It covers available endpoints, request and response schemas, authentication, error handling, and best practices to ensure reliable and secure integrations.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require an Access Key. Include the key in each request using the X-Access-Key header. The security scheme is defined in the OpenAPI specification.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "X-Access-Key": "Your token"
  }
]
```
